This folder contains the reproduction of some of the LeanDojo results. 

### Setup

Make sure your python environment has lean-dojo installed. In addition, you will need a working version of [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), tar and wget in your PATH. Finally, download and extract the [leandojo 4 benchmark](https://zenodo.org/records/10929138) into this directory.
